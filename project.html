        <h2>Personal Portfolio Website</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Tech Used:</strong> HTML, CSS, GitHub Pages<br>
          Designed and developed a responsive personal website from scratch using only HTML and CSS. This site showcases my skills, journey, and creative experiments with web layouts, positioning systems, and responsive design.
          I hosted the project using GitHub Pages, managed version control with Git, and I continue to improve it daily by refining sections and adding new features.
